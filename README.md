**Final Project Info**

Last year I took a Data Science course at Rakamin Academy, for 3 months. The final project in the course is predicting airline customer satisfaction. This prediction
will help the business team provide the best service to satisfy airline customers and make dissatisfied customers satisfied.
The dataset can be found on the kaggle website, you can open this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction).
- For the model explanation and business recomendation, you can check pdf file in this repo [link](https://github.com/kevinsimarmata/Kevin-Simarmata-Portfolio/blob/553f2f21d1f558e4b44f57af72a8990f70f56e7a/Final%20Project%20Rakamin%20-%20Team%20Slovin%20(1).pdf).
